      "It is interesting to note that not many people in this country today may know that until "
      "1949 when Prempeh College was founded, there was not a single government assisted "
      "or recognized secondary school in Ashanti and Northern Sector of the country. "
      "Students from these areas who were desirous of pursuing Secondary Education had "
      "to travel to the south to attend schools like Achimota, Accra Academy, Mfantsipim "
      "School, Adisadel College, St Augustine’s College and PRESEC at Krobo Odumasi."
      "The Colonial Government sought to correct this imbalance in the early 1940’s "
      "by inviting the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches, which had proven "
      "experience in running institutions of learning to start a Secondary School "
      "for boys.After some delays caused by the Second World War, the final "
      "decision to open a school for boys in Kumasi was taken in 1948. Prempeh "

  static const String INSECTS = "Food plays an important role in human lives. It comes in varieties of taste, colour as well"
      " as shape all over the world. However, due to some beliefs, personal preferences or any other reason, people find some "
      "food not befitting for human consumption. Most people are concerned with what they eat by putting into consideration "
      "the benefits as well as the religious beliefs (if any) about the food. Moreover the inclusion of insects into our diet "
      "known as Entomology seem as absurd by to most people. Let us review how entomology plays a vital role in our diet and"
      " most importantly, the Bible’s view point on it. The eggs, larvae and adults of certain species have been eaten by"
      " humans since prehistoric times and continue be an item of the human nutrition in contemporary times. Other commonly"
      " eaten insects are termites, cicadas and dragonflies. The eating of insects by humans is common to cultures in most"
      " parts of the world including the North, Central and America and Africa, Asia and New Zealand. Over 1000 species of "
      "insects are known to be eaten in 80% of the world’s nations and the number of ethnic groups recorded to practice Entomology "
      "is around 3000. However, in some societies, insect eating is uncommon or even, a taboo. Consumption of insects has various"
      " benefits. Edible insects contain high quality proteins, vitamins and amino acids for humans. Insects have a high food "
      "conservation rate. For instance, crickets need six times less feed than pigs and broiler chickens produce the same amount "
      "of protein. Besides, they emit less greenhouse gasses and ammonia than conventional livestock. What could the Bible "
      "standpoint be? The law covenant given to the ancient nation of Israel declared locust to be clean. Servant of the true "
      "God such as John the Baptist ate them. [Leviticus 11:22, Matthew 3:4, Mark 1:6]. Also taking a look at the restrictions "
      "given to the Israelites in their law they were asked not to eat food containing blood. The account at Acts 15:19….29 tells "
      "us how to abstain from blood. From the facts stated above people you would agree that insect eating is not absurd after all."

      " through whose invaluable contributions, Prempeh College has been in the spotlight as one of the top second cycle institutions in the country.The "
      "first or founding headmaster, Reverend Sidney Nesbitt Pearson (1949-1953) in his four-year term, set the trail blazing by making discipline and academic "
      "work his principal preoccupation. Majority of the permanent buildings were constructed and in use before he left. Rev. Pearson is said to have built Prempeh"
      " College, physically, educationally, and morally.His successor Mr. T. C Sims (1954-1958), proved himself to be an effective school administrator "
      "as well as a level headed man. He is credited with the formation of the Cadet Corp in 1955. Rear Admiral Ohene-Kwapong and a host of others who joined "
      "the Corps rose to become distinguished commissioned officers in the Ghana Armed Forces. Sixth form classes were introduced during his era as Headmaster."

      "are also said to have established a system of administration which became a model for their successors. The former was called ‘Osiadan‘"
      " ( He built nine staff bungalows) and later for the cultivation of large farms. He planted the school’s orchards and established the school farm. At the "
      "end of this era a sound foundation was laid and Prempeh College was on course for continued progress.Dr. T. A. Osae (1963-1976) the first African headmaster, "
      "brought the work of his predecessors to fruition and built on it. Under him Prempeh College was placed on a high pedestal, beating key schools academically for"
      " ten consecutive years, producing more students for the medical school than any other school and becoming National Athletics Champions. He is mostly fondly"

      "especially between 1980 and 1983. Exodus of teachers as well as shortages in essential inputs for teaching and learning negatively impacted on academic work to the"
      " extent that there was a fall in standards. Interestingly, just after he was transferred to headquarters in 1984, Prempeh College produced the best “A” level results "
      "in the country in 1985.Between 1985-1995 when Mr. Reuben T. Sackey held the mantle of headship, there was remarkable recovery, as Government gradually released funds for "
      "rehabilitation of the College. Dormitories as well as main classroom blocks and staff bungalows were renovated. Academic work improved significantly, with Prempeh"
      " College winning the maiden edition of National Science and Maths Quiz in 1994. Mr. Sackey is credited with writing the lyrics for the current College Anthem.After "

      "over as substantive Headmaster in 1998. He’s well known as “Sadam” , “Boss” and “Millennium Headmaster” , he ensured that the campus resumed its traditional orderliness "
      "and general state of cleanliness and embarked on the beautification of the compound. Academic excellence peaked in 2000 when overall best WAEC student and the best "
      "Science student was won by a student of the College.Mr. A. Owusu-Achiaw (2002-2009) took over from Mr. Afoakwa Sekyere and continued with his good works. Academic excellence "
      "was maintained, and in some few years back, Prempeh College had matriculated over 400 students KNUST alone, not to mention other universities. The College won the National"
      " Debate in 2004. He also initiated the building of a new Assembly Hall Complex and an 18-unit classroom block among other projects.Mr. Emmanuel K. Yeboah (2009-2015). He’s "
      "the immediate past Headmaster whose term of office came to an end in 2015 after he chalked so many victories, including breaking the long drought of National Science and"
      " Maths Quiz championships, National Robotics Champions, Hockey Champions, several Interco trophies, Milo Soccer Champions and many others. (are his laurels). He also recorded"

      " for less than six months and can already boast of World Robotics Champions in Michigan, USA. (May 2016). From this note of his beginning, I can conclude that the future is bright."
