### Create an Account and Obtain an App ID
To build and run the sample application, first obtain an app ID: 

1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/). Once you finish the sign-up process, you are redirected to the dashboard.
2. Navigate in the dashboard tree on the left to **Projects** > **Project List**.
3. Copy the app ID that you obtain from the dashboard into a text file. You will use this when you launch the app.

### Update and Run the Sample Application

Open the [entry.dart](lib/pages/entry.dart) file and add the app ID.

```dart
  final String _appId = "<Your AppId>";
```

Run the `packages get` command in your project directory:

```bash  
  # install dependencies
  flutter packages get
```

Once the build is complete, run the `run` command to start the app.

```bash
  # start app
  flutter run
```

**We recommend you to use IDE to control overall build process during development**

Details about how to set up the IDE please take a look at [here](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/editor?tab=vscode)
